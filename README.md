# CraigAT1181

Thanks for visiting my Github profile, my name is Craig and having completed a Software Engineering boot camp with Northcoders, I'm now devoted to completing my first full-stack application!

This application is a website that seeks to support a number of social enterprise goals around food security and strengthening food-independence throughout out communities.

The web application uses React on the front-end and Flask at the back, written in Python. Do feel free to check out the repo (pinned)!
